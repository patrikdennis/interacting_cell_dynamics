- Implement Pytrack for Tracking and proliferation event detection

prolif rate. -5,30, -5,35 uniform på 5 dagar. bra cluster också! 100 initial cells. borde kanske vara lägre?


—-levels 12 works fine!


try franzeg on the A1 transformed. 
try baxter on the A1 transformed.

not sure if we should keep the smoothing part for the contours.
maybe if we clip away “tails” of the cells?

if we keep the smoothing —> need to for the segmentation and debug overlay, overlay on the non-smoothed out image

need to get the squares for trackpy for the fogbank implementation

need to apply trackpy so that it works and fix all animations by wed. night.

test on the others aswell.
